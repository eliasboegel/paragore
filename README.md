# Paragore
A macro excel sheet to aid with parachute manufacturing. Takes in several parameters for a hemispherical-type parachute canopy and produces a to-scale graph of a single parachute gore that can be printed. This is useful when producing a parachute from flat pieces of fabric to produce the best approximation of a hemispherical shape when the gores are sown together.
